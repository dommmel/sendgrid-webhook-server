**About**This project implements a node HTTP server which can accept [webhook requests from SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Webhooks/index.html). The webhook calls from SendGrid occur when email is dropped, bounced, marked as spam, and a couple other conditions. The event information is formatted into HTML and posted into a HipChat room for monitoring.**Configuration**You'll need a HipChat API Auth Token of type Admin to be able to post messages to HipChat. You'll also need the room number of the HipChat room you want to post to. The room number can be had from the URL of the chat history web page for the room in question.In your SendGrid configuration, enable the Event Notification App. It is disabled by default. Within its settings, you can choose which kinds of events you're interested in. We typically monitor: dropped, bounced, unsubscribe, and spam.  Monitoring deferred events seemed to cause a lot of noise.**Batch event notifications:** Leave this unchecked, as the code can't handle batches yet.**Post Event URL:** https://yourserver.com/postSendGridMessage?apikey=a-valid-hipchat-api-key&room=a-valid-HipChat-room-number&user=your-sendgrid-subuser-id&environment=a-string-of-your-choosing**Thanks**Server and routing code was adapted from Manuel Kiessling's book, The Node Beginner Book at http://www.nodebeginner.org.**To Dos** - Remove dependence on SendGrid sub-user accounts. We use them, you might not. - Add support for "Batch event notifications" in SendGrid. - Add support for posting to multiple HipChat rooms
